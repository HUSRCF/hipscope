//! Railgun E0 / L6c: `Gpu` launchers for the multi-layer DFlash/MTP GDN
//! replay (gfx1201).
//!
//! `GdnTape::replay_gdn` advances every LinearAttention layer's conv ring and
//! recurrent state by `n_steps` tokens from the verify tape. Layers are
//! independent, so the per-layer launch sequence (conv1d + QK norm +
//! interleave + GDN: 4 launches x 48 layers on gfx1201) collapses to two
//! launches over a device pointer table with one row per layer:
//!
//! 1. [`Gpu::dflash_gdn_replay_pre_ml`] — the `dflash_gdn_pre_replay_gfx1100`
//!    preamble body per (block, layer), grid.y = layer.
//! 2. [`Gpu::gated_delta_net_q8_fast_ml`] — `gated_delta_net_q8_fast` built
//!    with the shipping defines plus `HIPFIRE_GDN_LAYER_TABLE`, grid.z =
//!    layer, frames reserved exactly as the per-layer launches would.
//!
//! Railgun D8 adds `_from` twins of both kernels (`DFLASH_GDN_REPLAY_STATE_SRC`
//! / `HIPFIRE_GDN_STATE_SRC`): the same bodies with the recurrent-state loads
//! redirected to a second table column, so the DFlash rollback replays from
//! the snapshot buffers into the live ones instead of restoring first.
//!
//! Both kernels read pointers from device memory, so a Redline tape could
//! not attribute their effects; the launchers therefore decline (return
//! `Ok(false)`) while a Redline recording is open. HipGraph capture is fine
//! (`launch_maybe_blob`). The pointer tables are owned by the caller.

///
/// 1. **One stream at a time.** Every replay launches on `Gpu::active_stream`:
///    `launch_replay_pre_ml` / `launch_gdn_q8_fast_ml` (this file, `:438`,
///    `:543`) go through `Gpu::launch_maybe_blob` (`dispatch.rs:2898`), which
///    launches on `self.active_stream`. The DFlash, MTP and VMM
///    continuous-batching paths create that stream once per `Gpu` and never
///    swap it (`hipfire-arch-qwen35/src/dflash_cb.rs:235`, `mtp_cb.rs:100`,
///    `speculative.rs:4120`); the only swaps are the per-rank devices of
///    `hipfire-runtime/src/multi_gpu.rs:3300`/`:3359`, each a separate `Gpu`
///    with its own scratch, and the MTP snapshot-overlap side stream
///    (`mtp_spec.rs:518`) only copies snapshots. Belt and braces:
///    [`Gpu::dflash_gdn_replay_scratch_order`] runs before every replay and
///    replay-graph launch and, when the stream differs from the entry's
///    previous replay, drains the device first (refused inside a capture).
/// 2. **Pointer lifetime.** The address is baked into each tape's tables and,
///    through them, into any `HIPFIRE_REPLAY_GRAPH` capture
///    (`graph.rs:487` `begin_replay_graph_capture`, from
///    `hipfire-arch-qwen35/src/speculative.rs:2260` `GdnTape::replay_gdn`).
///    An entry is released only when no armed tape holds it (`refs == 0`)
///    AND `GraphState::replay_graph_count() == 0` (`graph.rs:550`), and its
///    buffer never moves while it exists. Unload drains every entry; a tape
///    that outlives it fails loudly at its next replay
///    ([`Gpu::dflash_gdn_replay_scratch_order`] checks the entry still holds
///    the tape's base) instead of writing freed memory; unload also destroys
///    every replay graph (`Gpu::invalidate_graph_state`). Redline / railgun
///    PM4 recordings never contain the route: [`Gpu::gdn_replay_ml_eligible`]
///    (`:231`) requires `!replay.is_recording()` (`:240`).
/// 3. **No cross-replay reads.** Within one replay the preamble writes q/k/v
///    for every (layer, step < n_steps)
///    (`kernels/src/dflash_gdn_replay_pre_ml.hip:154`, `:155`, `:171`) before
///    the recurrence reads exactly those rows, and the recurrence's `out` is
///    never read; nothing outside the two launches touches the buffer. So no
