//! CPU-resident compressed radix tree over token spans (spec §4.2 C2).
//!
//! The `PrefixIndex` keys completed prefix state by [`CacheDomain`] (exact
//! identity, spec §4.1 C1) and the actual model input token sequence. Edges
//! store immutable token spans; nodes hold ordered [`PageHandle`]s for **full
//! 128-token pages only** plus optional [`CheckpointId`]s at resumable
//! boundaries (spec §4.5 C5). Partial KV pages are never shared: an exact
//! checkpoint boundary `B` (any value >= 1) stores only `floor(B/128)` full
//! pages and its residual `B % 128` tail is a pageless metadata edge.
//!
//! Operations: longest-prefix [`lookup`](PrefixIndex::lookup), [`insert`],
//! [`split`], [`pin`]/[`unpin`], and leaf-first [`evict_unpinned_leaves`].
//! Lookup pins matching page handles internally so eviction cannot drop them
//! until `unpin` (spec §4.4 C4). Eviction removes lookup visibility **before**
//! releasing cache refs.
//!
//! Exact checkpoints ([`publish_checkpoint`](PrefixIndex::publish_checkpoint) /
//! [`lookup_checkpoint`](PrefixIndex::lookup_checkpoint)) are keyed by the
//! exact token boundary. A boundary `B` is resumable when `B <= matched`,
//! `B < before`, and full pages `[0, floor(B/128))` are contiguous and valid.
//! Every checkpoint id that leaves visibility (forget, eviction, `release_all`)
//! is queued for [`take_retired_checkpoints`](PrefixIndex::take_retired_checkpoints)
//! BEFORE its pages' cache refs are released, so the payload owner can free
//! the blob.
//!
//! This module performs **no GPU mutation**. `add_cache_ref`/`release_cache_ref`/
//! `seal` are host-side operations on [`PagePool`] (spec §4.2: "Do not call
//! PagePool from lookup in a way that mutates GPU memory").
//!
//! # Token-count distinction (spec §4.2)
//!
//! - **matched_tokens**: equal token prefix in the index.
//! - **resident_kv_tokens**: matching attention rows that still exist (full
//!   pages whose `PageHandle` is still valid).
//! - **resumable_tokens**: largest boundary for which a checkpoint exists AND
//!   all required pages are still resident.
//!
//! A prefix match that lacks a recurrent checkpoint is [`MissReason::NoCheckpoint`],
//! not a hit in usage accounting (spec §4.2).
