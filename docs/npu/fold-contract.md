# Dense Qwen3.8-27B fold/co-op decision

Scope: live0.4.1 dark opt-in experiment, cutoff Mon2026-10-05 23:59MST. Hipfire source `W=/home/kaden/ClaudeCode/warpfront/wt-land-041m`, read-only. This branch contains CPU research and planning, not runtime changes. Flash-Next is deprioritized; no further Flash error/payoff work.

## 1. Measured decision: G0/G1 KILLED

**Do not implement or land the original full-IEF15 G1 config/sidecar/route slices.** G0 failed its1.03x speed gate by a large margin, despite exact new-contract bytes and zero spills. Main now requests **mixed-contract co-op**: current GPU fold on GPU-owned columns, IEF15 only on NPU-owned columns. Full IEF15 is retained only as a transferred gfx1152 sensitivity, not a revived implementation plan.

Measured Halo G0 branch `exp/ief15-g0`@`7559ee957`, worktree `/home/kaden/ClaudeCode/warpfront/wt-ief15-g0`. Evidence `agent://Ief15G0`; hardware files `ssh://hipx/home/kaden/pm-wave/ief15-g0/logs/{edge-1,correct-1,time-1,time-2,time-3}.txt`. Each timed process used its own timing lock,1s DPM warmup and4ABBAblocks×4reps;3 fresh processes, byte-identical A/Xq between routes. S/a/D/b production was **not charged**, so a real producer only worsens this result. Comparison is tuned PM V2B SET/ADD/SiLU, and shipped `_set_zba` for Z|beta|alpha, not an upstream naive baseline.

Probe MD5 `ef9e1ee39ed28632d2dfc27023007c31`; PM bundle MD5 `cfa66665c06e010e0064f2151896f763`; all input MD5s are in the G0 structured report.243VGPR SET/ADD/SiLU, zero private segment/spill counts/scratch instructions. Exact SET/ADD/SiLU edge corpus and all seven dense shapes passed CPU oracle comparison; eager/graph-replay output bytes identical. Integer pack model passed~2M random plus~490k tie/carry/subnormal/overflow cases. These are **peer-observed** results, not tests run by this research agent. G0 has no runtime selection or incumbent changes.

Cause supported by the implementation census: five integer VALU operations/output/epoch, noVOPD, plus M256×N128 retile,64int64states/wave,48KiBLDS. Incumbent uses three scalar operations/output packed into12VOPDpackets/8outputs (`W:crates/hipfire-isa/src/kernels/iu4_fold.rs:30-48`), M256×N256 and128f32sumVGPRs (`iu4_v2b.rs:57,105-124`). Zero spills do not make integer carry chains or repeated weight reads free. The original G0/G1 path is killed, not 'almost viable'.

## 2. Denominator and honest ceilings

Measured dense pp8192 step6810.69ms, IU4GEMMs5287.408ms, remainder1523.282ms,399.6TOP (`docs/dense27b.md:20-33,167`). Thus77.6% is the **entire-bucket time ceiling**, not a co-op prediction. Old fold-free26.9TOPS NPU model was only+10.9% throughput; old exactf32 emulation model+1–3% (`:150-175`). Full IEF15 now has a measured1.57x GPU penalty. **Halo+10–15% is not supported by either new model below.** gfx1152 remains the primary modeled payoff because its GPU is much smaller; there are no gfx1152 measurements here.

## 3. Frozen NPU IEF15 arithmetic and sidecars

For unchanged nibbles/activation codes:

`C[t,r,e]=sum(j=0..127) (u[r,128e+j]-8)*q[t,128e+j]`, exacti32,range[-7168,8192]. Current contract is ascending epoch `sum=fmaf(RN_f32(sc_e*d_e),float(C_e),sum)` from+0 (`W:iu4_fold.rs:3-9,36-48`). Original AWQ/FWHT and A4 clipping are untouched.

For each finite nonnegative scale vector choose the **smallest integer** a for which all `RNE_integer(v_e*2^-a)<=32767`; allzero usesa=0. For one weight row encode S15 across all its epochs with exponenta_r; for one token encode D15 across all its epochs with exponentb_t. Device exponent selection uses exponent bits and exact integer rounding, not approximate log2. Preserve q; this is post-quantization scale projection, not re-clipping.

`I[t,r]=sum_e i64(S[r,e])*i64(D[t,e])*i64(C[t,r,e])`; `Y=RNE_binary32(I*2^(a_r+b_t))`, **one** final rounding. E<=136 implies |I|<2^51. No atomics. K partitions retain/merge signed64 states before rounding; never sum rounded f32 partials. Integerzero maps+0; negative underflow maps-0. Handle subnormals/ties/overflow directly; i64->f64->f32 can double round and is forbidden. Nonfinite/negative scales reject before slot publication. CPU oracle `tools/npu/fold-model/src/lib.rs::{grid,fixed,round_scaled}`.

Version1 sidecars, LE, no MQ4 format change:
- S:u16 `[local_feature][K/128]`,a:i16 `[local_feature]`, everymantissa<=32767.
- D:u16 epoch-major `[K/128][token]`,b:i16 `[token]`; computed after every existing A4 producer write, not cached across changed activations.
- Immutable original QT44 bytes and72B A4 `[epoch][token]` blocks remain address-stable inputs. No flag-off allocations/launches.
- NPU dense output token-major f32 `[token][local_feature]`,pre-SiLU/pre-residual. GPU owns exact existingSiLU (`W:iu4_v2b.rs:753-758`) and `RN(old+Y)` ADD/deferred residual semantics. Padding outputs+0. Separate g/u outputs are paired by hidden-feature index, not independent column cuts.
- Existing ringv1 fixed-slot offsets/program identity from `docs/npu/railgun-npu.md:62-95` remain; IEF15 needs a distinct program/output-contract cache identity, never an int8/int32 program reinterpretation.

## 4. Mixed contract: split is part of numeric identity

**GPU-owned output columns retain current ascending f32FMA, with no IEF15 GPU kernel or scale sidecar. NPU-owned columns use IEF15.** This intentionally changes the original shared-all-device contract after Main's measured kill decision.

For identical incoming A4/scales, GPU-column fold error vs current is exactly0; NPU-column error is the IEF15 measurement in§5. Error does not disappear merely because the other columns are exact. Representative pooled NRMSE might scale roughlysqrt(f) under uniform signal/error distribution, but that is **INFERENCE**, not a bound: offloaded rows may contain the largest errors. Raw maximum relative error remains cancellation-sensitive. The model does not prove end-to-end layer/logit error; after one changed projection, subsequent hidden states, d and q can change. SiLU nonlinearity also prevents reusing raw fold error as a post-SiLU guarantee.

Determinism requirements:
1. Freeze exact per-projection sorted feature ranges before execution/capture. A '17%' setting is insufficient: record integer ranges, paired g/u cuts, K segmentation, output layout, grid policy and finalpack version.
2. Bind that map plus model/weight identity and contractversion into graph/Redline/prefill-cache/run identity. A different split means a different numeric execution even with identical prompts. No load-adaptive/thermal/occupancy-dependent split changes within a reproducibility claim.
3. Disjoint columns publish once. GPU completion/NPU completion order cannot affect sums; every integer Kpartition joins beforeoneRNE, epilogue/ADD executes once, DONE only after all C channels join.
4. NPU timeout/unavailable/wedge **fails closed**. Silent fallback to currentGPU on NPU-owned columns changes bytes. A same-contract fallback would need to replay IEF15 on exactly those columns (G0 is too slow to be a promoted GPU route); not in this plan. `HIPFIRE_NPU_SPILLOVER=0` returns the original whole-GPU execution, a different explicitly selected numeric identity.
5. Keep only default-OFF co-op flag `kernel.npu_spillover` / `HIPFIRE_NPU_SPILLOVER` (`W:crates/hipfire-config/src/lib.rs:2601`). Do not add the killed proposed `HIPFIRE_IU4_FOLD_CONTRACT` GPU setting or route. The co-op program/map identifies NPU IEF15; caller owns its fixed-map schema.

GPU-current split speed is still an **assumption**, not proven by G0: incumbent kernels have no independent outputLDY/column offset. A PM-authored strided **current-fold** entry or compact+copy must preserve the exact fold and price all movement. Do not charge zero for a full output gather. A current-fold strided entry changes address arithmetic only, not WMMA/fold order; its own speed/parity gate precedes integration.

## 5. Dense CPU errors, per GEMM and all64layers

Artifact `/home/kaden/pm-wave/g11fa2/models/qwen3.8-27b.mq4-xts`,14,987,185,152B. Stored scales/nibbles, never random weights.496tensors/all64layers,32evenly spaced feature rows/tensor,8synthetic rotated-domain tokens;126,976fold outputs,57,655,296weight bytes. Real dense A4 dumps were not located in inspected g11fa2/gemm-compare/fold-scs/fold-kernels/iu4roof workspaces; no new capture/hardware experiment here.

Deterministic seed0x6a09e667f3bcc909; CLTnormal activations with epoch amplitudeexp(0.4*N). Correct producer c2 **candidate indices**{5,7}, not divisors5/7; four-consecutive-elements/lane f32FMA MSE plus XORreduction mirror `W:kernels/src/block_i4_128_quant.hip:94-126,213-217`. All compared folds share identical modeled q/d. Earlier provisional divisor5/7 numbers are superseded. Device fast-reciprocal producer equality is not inferred from CPU math.

0/847,872 **sampled** weight scales lost precision on15 or16bit grids, not an all-weight proof. CurrentNRMSEvsf641.438134e-7; zero reference mismatches0. IEF16 improves aggregate precision but not every nearzero output's relative error; maximum is not monotonic in mantissa bits.

F64reference is ascendingΣf64(sc)*f64(d)*f64(C), without per-epoch f32rounding, not an exact real-arithmetic superaccumulator. Mean relative error averagesabs(delta)/abs(reference) over nonzero samples; maximum uses the same cancellation-sensitive denominator. NRMSE=sqrt(Σdelta²/Σf64reference²). All metrics are **pre-epilogue**. Layer tables pool sampled projection outputs, not propagated layer-state/logit errors. No KLD used.

Full requested tables [`numeric-tables.md`](../tools/fold-model/numeric-tables.md):5-30 summary/perGEMM,34-99 every64layer. Per-candidate/per-tensor/kind/layer details [`dense-errors.json`](../tools/fold-model/dense-errors.json). Layer error/probabilistic quality and decoded-output review remain model-level gates; table values alone cannot promote changed numerics.

## 6. Candidate AIE/GPU costs

Slot lower bounds are **estimates/instruction census**, not NPU IEF measurements.16-lane issue model `crates/pm-npu/src/kernels/iu4_fold_model.rs:7-46`; measured GEMM.331cycles/output/epoch (`docs/dense27b.md:90-100`), nativeVMACfloor.25. Vecslot competes with GEMM; apparent.081slack is not automatically free.

No uniform output-relative bound exists for the scale projection because C terms can cancel. Grid absolute scale error<=0.5*2^a is the actual arithmetic bound. Full exactfold writeback int32partials remains~3TOPS/writebound, not a fallback route (`docs/dense27b.md:101-119`).

## 7. Halo/gfx1152 payoff: mixed versus full IEF15

HIP may report20WGPs instead of40CUs; no double counting. Two64bit channels imply128GB/sLPDDR5X8000 or89.6GB/sDDR55600 **theoretical**, not sustained. NPU50marketingTOPS is not an IEF measurement.

Reproducible model `tools/npu/fold-model/src/bin/payoff.rs`, output [`payoff.json`](../tools/fold-model/payoff.json). Both modes optimize256weight-row cuts, **gate/up512combined rows =256paired hidden features** to retain incumbent V2B admission (`W:gemm.rs:33901-33924` calls `iu4_v2_tile` at20543-20549). Mixed GPU ratio1.00 assumes incumbent current-strided speed; full ratio1.57 transfers HaloG0 to gfx1152 as an estimate, not its measurement. Trace5287.408ms denominator remains fixed; G0's5004–5046ms microbench total is not substituted for the traced step.

`T=max(alpha*(1-f)*g*gpu_ratio, f*ops/(P*.853)+.215ms)+.020ms+metadata+NPUcolumn_epilogue`, with55GB/sNPUportcap.

Repeated-tile traffic matters; one host operand copy perGEMM is not the memory denominator. Locali64I traffic/retileactualport, producerpacking and stridedGPU costs are unmeasured. Metadata/epilogue rate200GB/s is assumed. beta.853 andGPUderate(+2.2/5.9/11.3%at5.3/16/46.9GB/s) are borrowed from Halo measurements flaggedunreliable4.13%drift (`docs/dense27b.md:140-158`).

Old215usperNPUsubmit and20usringhandoff retained conservatively; persistentdenseIEF mayremove215us only afternewshapeproof. Peerlog `/home/kaden/qcal/npu-agents/coop/logs/coop/coop-w2-0fe69f9.log:4,14-20,37-38,56-57` shows livealias andemptyringGPU p503.13uspub->done/5.77usconsecutivepublish/17.58uswall, andsmallfixture32/32GPU-read exactparity. These prove plumbing, notdenseIEFthroughput orgraphcorrectness. Replacing20uswith5.77us alone saves atmost4.90ms/344calls.

**All table gains/shares are ESTIMATES.** gfx1152 remainder scales2x(memoryproxy) or4.444x(computeproxy), GPU-alonestep26.55–30.27s. Endpoints include2.44/3.05B/kop andbothremaindercases, not guaranteed bounds on smallpackagepower/thermal behavior. Percentage is throughputgain, nottimesaved.

Mixed is strictly preferable here, avoids1.57xGPUcost, but loses split-independent whole-GEMM numeric identity. Measuring onlyHalo cannot promote gfx1152; its clocks/port/topology/power/actualNPUrates remainunknown.

## 8. Revised independent composer slices (mixed only)

Main orchestrates; reviewers own final admission. OriginalG0/G1 are killed. No project-widebuild/test/formatter midflight. This is an **implementation plan**, not a claim these modules exist. Main's `docs/coop-dense27b.md` owns buffer/sync/packing lifecycle; this document owns arithmetic/error/splitidentity.

Owner:metadata composer. Own new `W:crates/rdna-compute/src/npu_ief15_scales.rs` and `W:crates/hipfire-isa/src/kernels/npu_ief15_scales.rs`; Main owns shared registrations. Frozen CPU API `encode_npu_ief15_qt44_scales(payload:&[u8],rows:usize,k:usize)->Result<(Vec<u16>,Vec<i16>),String>` returns S/a from load-time original bytes. Frozen host API `Gpu::fill_npu_ief15_scales(&mut self,xq:&GpuTensor,d:&GpuTensor,b:&GpuTensor,tokens:usize,k:usize)->HipResult<()>` fills caller-preallocated D/b. PMargs `(Xq,D,b,tokens,K)` =threeu64ptrs+twou32,32B. Exact exponent-bit/RNE grid, zero/tie/subnormal/nonfinite rejection, no q changes or weight readback. Regenerate D/b after every A4 write; no flag-off buffers/launches or capture-time allocation. Direct-launch byte oracle with changed inputs, producer-cost measurement and emitted bundle/type handoff are acceptance; no GPU IEF fold/schema.

### M2 — current-fold strided split proof (independent of M0)

Owner:GPU current-route composer. Own new `W:crates/hipfire-isa/src/kernels/iu4_current_split.rs` and `W:crates/rdna-compute/examples/iu4_current_split_probe.rs`; Main owns shared registrations. Never reuse G0's IEF five-op kernel. Anchor `W:hipfire-isa/src/kernels/iu4_v2b.rs:92-100,508-555,687-748`; preserve WMMA/fmaf/SiLU, change feature-window addresses only. Proposed `emit(Spec{arch:Arch,epi:Epi})->Result<Emitted,String>` uses existing proof types. SET `(A,Xq,Y,M,K,N,LDY,COL0)` =threeu64ptrs+fiveu32,44B; ADD appendsGSHIFT,48B; SiLU `(G,U,Xq,Y,M,K,N,LDY,COL0)` =fourptrs+fiveu32,52B. Rebase A to local rows; Xq shared; Y offset `token*LDY+COL0+row`. SiLU M counts paired hidden features (34816combined rows=>M17408), LDY/COL0 are hidden-output units. Keep M%256 admission; paired cut256hidden/512combined. Flag-off config/schema/bundles unchanged.
